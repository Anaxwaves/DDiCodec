A New Software Dolby-C & B Option — DDi Codec
 		 
 	The arguments on pros and cons of Dolby-B/C system have been around for decades. There seems to be equal number of opinions to accept or reject Dolby-B/C in Hi-Fi audio. The advocators suggest that Dolby-B/C can achieve high fidelity on a well calibrated system. The dissenters state that there is no guarantee to keep the analog encoder, the tape and the decoder perfectly aligned over decades of span.

 	Since digital age, there seemed to be an easy solution — retooling Dolby B/C system in software. While the wish is fantastic, the fact is not as easy as it sounded. Dolby-B/C system has very unique non-linear characteristics of its own, which is not covered by the modern DSP theory in general. Attempting to simulate Dolby-B/C by customizing a linear EQ plugin is a simplistic, inaccurate and amateurish idea.

 	DDI Codec is crafted based on extensive study of the original Dolby-B/C analog system, combined with revers-engineering a few reputable analog Dolby-B/C hardware units. The proprietary digital technologies developed for building the core engine are very dedicated to closely reproduce the specific non-linear sliding-band characteristics that only found in Dolby-B/C system. The software strives for the state-of-the-art digital solution of Dolby-C (with full backward compatibility with Dolby-B) which is not only sounding correct but also measured correct.
